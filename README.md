# highly opinionated boilerplate-setup for three.js projects.

This is my personal preference boilerplate and starting-point for three.js projects.

## how do I run it?

    // git clone, download or otherwise obtain sourcecode and switch to project-directory
    npm install
    npm start

## what's in the box?

 - a minimalistic demo-application
 - `three.js`, `dat-gui` preconfigured for simple applications
 - `npm run`-based build and development/autobuild-toolchain
 - `browserify` and `babel` configured for ES6
 - configuration to load three.js externally
 - `stylus` is used for stylesheets (with `autoprefixer`)
 - a development-server (`budo`)
 - build-for-production task (`uglify`, `html-inline`)
